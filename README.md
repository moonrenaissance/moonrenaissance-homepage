[Daniel Clover - Homepage](https://moonrenaissance-homepage.vercel.app/) ||
This is literally one of my first projects and I had so much fun creating it, I also learned a lot in the process.

## Stack/What I learned and used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - A back-end JavaScript runtime environment
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering, and route pre-fetching, etc.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - A simple, modular and accessible component library for React
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - An animation library for React
- SVG - An XML-based vector image format
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - A distributed version control system
